  <h1>About me</h1><br>

  <p>I am a fresh graduate in the IT field, with a love for IoT, SmartHome, and Multimedia technologies. <br>
  Worked in another amazing field during the university, so maybe not so experienced as pure IT students, but my strong enthusiasm will help me to catch up with it.</p>

  <p>I have studied at University of Zilina, in the beautiful, same-called city on the north of Slovakia.</p>
  
  <p>I’m really excited about all the new technologies and the possibilities they give us to explore in this fast changing world. I want to work on projects which will help to make cities more efficient, which will truely allow people to have more time, while experiencing the excitement from tech world.</p>

  <p>I hate to place a “Smart” stickers on everything just because it has a display. I believe that smart things should truely allow people to feel more confortable, and save their time, not to require them to set something up for 20 minutes only to get a notification that washer machine finished its work. Wanna know what else would I do? Write me an email!</p>
