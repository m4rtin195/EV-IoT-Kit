            <blockquote>
                <p>It's a group of projects that make up the <b>proof-of-concept</b> of the system, which allows the vehicle owner to check its state during the charging process when he is not close, or in any other situation.
                Everything is designed with an emphasis on <b>simplicity</b> and <strong>reliability</strong> for the <i>user</i>, and <b>scalability</b> and <b>modularity</b> for the <i>developer</i>. Individual technologies can be easily switched for some others, according to the needs of the real project.</p>
                <p>Or, just a useful example of a full-stack IoT application.</p>
